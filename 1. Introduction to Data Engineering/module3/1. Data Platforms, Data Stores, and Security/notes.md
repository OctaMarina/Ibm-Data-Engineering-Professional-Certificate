# Architecting the Data Platform
## Layers of a Data Platform Architecture:
1. **Data Ingestion Layer**: Responsible for collecting data from various sources, such as databases, APIs, and file systems.
2. **Data Storage Layer**: Where data is stored, which can include data lakes, data warehouses, and databases.
3. **Data Processing Layer**: Involves transforming and processing data, often using tools like Apache Spark or Apache Flink.
4. **Data Access Layer**: Provides interfaces for users and applications to access the data, often through APIs or query languages.
5. **Data Pipeline Layer**: Manages the flow of data between different components of the platform, ensuring data is moved and transformed as needed.

# Factors for Selecting and Designing Data Stores
## A repository can be:
- Database
- Data Warehouse
- Data Lake
- Data Mart
- Big Data Store

## Primary Factors for Selecting and Designing Data Stores:
1. **Type of Data**: Consider whether the data is structured, semi-structured, or unstructured.
2. **Data Volume**: Evaluate the amount of data to be stored and processed.
3. **Intended use of Data**: Determine how the data will be used, such as for analytics, reporting, or real-time processing.
4. **Storage considerations**: Assess the storage requirements, including performance, scalability, and cost.

# Security
## Enterprise-level Data Platforms and Data Repositories need to tackle security at multiple levels:
1. **Physical Infrastructure Security**: Protecting the physical servers and data centers where data is stored.
2. **Network Security**: Ensuring secure communication channels, such as using VPNs and firewalls.
3. **Application Security**: Implementing security measures within applications that access and process data.

## Key components to creating a secure data platform:
- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that sensitive data is only accessible to authorized users.
- **Integrity**: Maintaining the accuracy and consistency of data over its lifecycle.
- **Availability**: Ensuring that data is accessible when needed, without interruptions.
