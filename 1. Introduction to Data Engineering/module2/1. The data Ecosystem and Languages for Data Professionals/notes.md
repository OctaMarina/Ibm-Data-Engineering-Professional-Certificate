# The Data Ecosystem and Languages for Data

## Overview of the Data Engineering Ecosystem
### A Data Engineer's ecosystem includes the infrastructure, tools, frameworks, and processes for:
* Extracting data from disparate sources
* Architecting and managing data pipelines for transformation, integration, and storage of data
* Developing applications needed through the data engineering workflow

### Data:
- Structured: follows a rigid format and can be organized into rows and columns
- Semi-Structured: Mix of data that has consistent characteristics and data that does not conform to a rigid structure.(Emails,JSON etc..)
- Unstructured: Data that is complex and mostly qualitative information that cannot be structured into rows and columns.

### Qualitative vs Quantitative data:
Quantitative data refers to numerical information that can be measured and analyzed statistically, while qualitative data refers to descriptive information that captures characteristics, opinions, or experiences.

### Qualitative data examples:
Customer feedback, Interview response, Product review:

### Data Repositories:
- Transactional(Online Transaction Processing(OLTP)): Designed to store high volume day-to-day operational data(airline flights, bank transfers).
Are typically relational, but can also be non-relational
- Analytical(Online Analytical Processing(OLAP)): Optimized for conducting complex data analytics.
Include relational and non-relational databases, data warehouses, data marts, data lakes, and big data stores


### Data Integration:
Collated -> Processed -> Cleansed -> Integrated -> Users
Combine data from disparate sources into a unified view, accessed by users to query and manipulate the data.

### Data Pipelines: 
A set of tools and processes that cover the entire journey of data from source to destination systems.
